# Omeji-Mustapha
I'm an electrical and electronic engineering student at Lead City University, specializing in control engineering. Passionate about web development and technical writing, I have completed several projects, including a Hangman game deployed on Vercel, and I'm currently working on a matrix calculator and other side projects.
